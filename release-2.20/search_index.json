All changes or additions from this\npoint on shall conform to this specification. Pre-existing code does not need\nto be updated for the sole purpose of conforming to this specification. As\nconforming updates are made, the developer may update other content within the\nmodified file to bring it within compliance with this specification. Code\noriginally developed for other environments that has been ported to, or\nmodified for, the EDK II environment, is not obligated to conform. However, any\nnew code added to the ported code must conform.\nThis specification addresses the chronic problem of providing accurate\ndocumentation of the code base by embedding the documentation within the code.\nWhile this does not guarantee that the documentation will be kept up to date,\nit significantly increases the chances. A document generation system, Doxygen,\nthen produce formatted documentation by extracting information from specially\nformatted comment blocks and the syntactic elements of the code.\nThis specification presents protocol standards that will ensure that the\ncontractual relationship between APIs and their callers is clear and well\nmaintained.\nThis specification describes standard practices designed to eliminate or\nmitigate pitfalls inherent in the C language.\nIn recognition that a coding standard of this size can be a bit daunting, a\nconcise reference to the standard's key elements is available in \"Quick\nReference\".\n1.2 Rationale\nSoftware engineering is much more than writing code that will work one time.\nSoftware engineering entails writing code that:\n\nMeets project requirements.\n\nIs testable.\n\nCan be maintained by the author or by others that have varying degrees of\nexperience and familiarity with the code.\n\nMinimizes the learning curve for programmers new to the product. (Our\ncustomers)\n\n\nWe use the C programming language because of its simplicity, flexibility, and\nwide support. On the downside in that each developer's C code could\n(conceivably) be constructed in totally different and inconsistent ways. This\nlack of uniformity makes understanding and maintaining the code very difficult.\nUniformity is the key theme of these rules. You may disagree with some of our\ndecisions. Nevertheless, we ask that you commit to conforming to standards of\nthis specification. Also, there are pitfalls inherent in the C language that\nthis style guide may help you to avoid. The goal of this document is making\nyou, and those who follow you, more productive.\nSome of the strict rules for protocol and driver construction may seem overly\nonerous. Don't panic - there is a method to our madness - we intend to\nconstruct wizards to aid in the construction of protocol include files and\ndevice driver templates. The resulting consistency will help prevent name\ncollision and require much less rote memory (or code surfing) to remember the\nnames of protocol declarations or GUID definitions.\nGood software engineers think about maintaining a consistent and uniform coding\nstyle. Having a set of rules to follow allows them to spend time solving actual\nproblems and less time thinking about style. Junior software engineers may not\nsee the benefits, but now is a good time for them to start thinking about what\nit will take to maintain their code. Junior software engineers will also\nbenefit by being able to understand other people's code much more easily\nbecause the code will be written in a consistent manner. Consistency and\nuniformity enable productivity.\nIn conclusion, it's uniformity, uniformity, uniformity. With that said, this\ndocument is not intended to be dogma. However, violating a rule is contingent\non valid reasons for the violation, and the approval of the various\nstakeholders involved. It is not something to venture into lightly and is not\nrecommended.\n1.3 Scope\nThis specification describes stylistic conventions and requirements as they\napply to writing C code for inclusion within the EDK II code base. Its bulk is\nintended to provide rationale and disambiguating detail for each rule and\nrequirement. The rules are also presented in summary form for quick reference.\nRationale and detail for each of the rules is then presented in subsequent\nsections.\nThe majority of code produced for EDK II must support multiple compilers and be\nable to be retargeted to multiple processor and system architectures. This\nrequires coding practices to conform to the \"lowest common denominator\" of the\nsupported tools, processor, and system architectures.\nThe C dialect we use is ISO/IEC 9899:199409, or C95, with some elements from\nC99 If you are not familiar with this dialect, refer to Harbison and Steele's\nC: A Reference Manual. This is the language dialect held in common with all\nof the compilers supported by EDK II.\n\nNote: There are some significant differences between ANSI C (C89) and the\ndialect recognized by compilers supported by EDK II (C95). These differences\nprimarily revolve around use of the external storage class and the elimination\nof implicit types and storage classes.\n\nThe use of compiler-specific language extensions is very strongly discouraged.\nTopics covered in this coding standard include:\n\nFile structure and formats\nC language rules and guidelines\nNaming Conventions\nDocumentation\nCommenting rules\nDoxygen\n\nThese guidelines represent an attempt make you aware of your actions, because\nthose actions affect the future readers and maintainers of the code you produce.\nPre-existing code ported to the EDK II environment does not have to conform to\nthis specification. New code which is added to, or which accompanies, the\nported code must conform.\nThis specification considers the core firmware, applications, and individual\nUEFI drivers as distinct and separate units. This is because UEFI drivers, like\napplications, are not linked to the main body of code and do not expose their\ninternal namespaces to other components of the firmware system.\n1.4 References\n\nMISRA-C: 2004 Guidelines for the use of the C language in critical systems,\nTyler Doering http://www.misra-c.com, Guidelines for the Use of the C\nLanguage in Critical Systems, ISBN 978-1-906400-10-1 (paperback), ISBN\n978-1-906400-11-8 (PDF), March 2013.\n\nUniversal Principles of Design by William Lidwell, Kritina Holden, and Jill\nButler.

It is likely\nthat your design will not be able to achieve all of these goals; if it does,\nyour design is very good indeed. Note that some of these design goals\ncontradict other design goals. Contradiction is part of the challenge of doing\na good design.\nMaintainability of software is of such importance that those principles are\nexpanded separately in \"Principles for Software Maintenance\".\n2.1 Software Design\nThe following is an alphabetical list of software design principles:\nAccessibility\nThis entails designing objects and environments to be usable, with no\nmodification, by the greatest number of people as possible, including people\nwith varying educational and social backgrounds, as well as those with motor or\nsensory challenges.\nAlignment\nElements within a design should be aligned with one or more other elements.\nAlignment of related or like elements within a design reduces the perception of\ndisorder and promotes understanding.\nChunking.\nChunking groups units of information into a small number of units (maximum of\nfour plus or minus one) to help the efficient processing of information by\nshortterm memory, as well as to accommodate its limits.\nConfirmation.\nThis is a technique used for critical actions, inputs, or commands.\nConfirmations are primarily used to prevent unintended actions. Minimize errors\nin critical or irreversible operations with confirmations. If you overuse\nconfirmations, expect that they will be ignored Avoid overusing confirmations\nto ensure that they remain unexpected and uncommon; otherwise, they may be\nignored. Use a two-step operation for hardware confirmations and dialogs for\nsoftware confirmations.\nConsistency.\nExpress similar parts or concepts in similar ways to make a system to improve\nusability and learnability. Apply consistency to design and coding style, as\nwell as user interfaces. Do not apply consistency to the point of compromising\nclarity or usability.\nMaintainability\nDesign for the maintenance programmer or sustaining engineer for\nmaintainability, or ease of maintenance. The design of the system should be\nself-explanatory.\nExtensibility\nExtensibility entails enhancing a system without violating the underlying\nstructure. The most likely changes should cause the system the least trauma.\nFor example, you know the BIOS is responsible for booting the system, so adding\na new type of boot device should not cause trauma to the system. Be careful\nabout the assumptions you make.\nForgiveness\nDesign to help users avoid errors and reduce the negative consequences of\nerrors any errors made. Recommended methods for achieving design forgiveness\ninclude affordances, reversibility of actions, and safety nets. Effectively\ndesigning for forgiveness results in a design needing minimal confirmations,\nwarnings, and help.\nHigh fan-in\nSharing a high number of routines that call a given routine produces high\nfan-in. Sharing entails designing a system to make good use of utility routines\nat the lower levels.\nHorror Vacui\nThis is a Latin phrase for \"fear of emptiness\", which is the desire to fill\nempty spaces with information or objects. Research shows that as horror vacui\nincreases, perceived value decreases. In programming, lines consisting solely\nof comment characters, with no actual comment, are good examples of horror\nvacui.\nIntellectual manageability\nIntellectual manageability is a primary goal in any system. It is essential to\nthe overall system integrity and affects how easily programmers can initially\nbuild a system as well as maintain it later.\nInterference Effects\nWhen two or more perceptual (or cognitive) processes are in conflict, the\ncompeting mental processes slow down mental processing or make mental\nprocessing less accurate. Examples of this include violations of convention (a\nred OK light), information conflicts\n(a color name, GREEN, in a different color), and\nincorrect use of opposites.\nLeanness\nDesign the system so that it has no extra parts, i.e. \"lean\". If you add extra\ncode, remember that it needs to be developed, reviewed, tested, maintained,\nunderstood, and taken into account when the code is modified. Also, future\nversions of the code may have to be backward compatible with the extra code.\nLow complexity\nLow complexity is part of intellectual manageability.\nMinimal connectedness\nDesign so that you keep connections among subprograms to a minimum. This\nminimizes work during integration, testing, and maintenance. Use industry\nstandards whenever possible. Make sure you are not reinventing something that\nalready exists.\nMinimize code size\nUnlike many software engineering projects, EDK II firmware is targeted to be\nstored in a device that represents a tangible cost to the system. Thus, the\nminimization of code size is important to reduce the overall cost of a system.\nPortability\nDesign the system so that it is easily moved to another environment. With EDK\nII, making sure the code will run on IA32, X64 and Intel(R) Itanium(R)\nprocessors (IPF) is an example of portability.\nReusability\nDesign the system so that pieces of it can be reused in other systems. In EDK\nII, reusability also means designing code so that it can be used in various\nclasses of platforms from embedded systems to massively parallel computers.\nStandard techniques\nGreater reliance on unique or exotic pieces makes a system harder to\nunderstand, and more intimidating for someone trying to understand it the first\ntime. Using standardized, common approaches should be to give the whole system\na familiar feeling. This standardization is one of the primary goals of this\ndocument.\nStratified design\nIn order to view the system at any single level and get a consistent view of\nit, you should attempt to keep the levels of decomposition layered. The OSI\nmulti-layernetworking model is an example of stratified design.\n2.2 Principles for Software Maintenance\n2.2.1 Understand the problem before you fix it.\nThe best way to ruin a code base is to attempt to fix problems without a clear\nunderstanding of the problem itself. If your fix is out of context, the next\nfix in the routine will be four times more complicated. Triangulate the error\nwith cases that should and should not cause the error. Keep at it until you\nunderstand the error.\n2.2.2 Understand the program, not just the problem.\nUnderstanding the context in which a problem occurs will increase your\nlikelihood of solving the problem completely.\n2.2.3 Fix the symptom AND the underlying problem.\nFix the symptom, but your focus should be on fixing the underlying problem.\nWithout thoroughly understanding the problem, you will not fix the code. You\nwill also feel very uncomfortable when a peer reviews your fix before you check\nit into the source base.\n2.2.4 Change the code only for good reason.\nDo not change code at random until it seems to work; that isn't effective. If\nyou do this you are not learning anything and are just goofing around. You\nshould have confidence that a change will work before making a change. Being\nwrong about a change should be rare and cause personal reevaluation.\n2.2.5 Do not debug by superstition.\nDon't blame every problem on the computer, bad data, or the effects of a full\nmoon. You wrote the program; take responsibility for it.\n2.2.6 Don't blame everyone else's code.\nIt is human nature to trust the code that you wrote and understand, and to\ndistrust all other code. You must resist this tendency and root cause the\nproblem systematically.\n2.2.7 Don't use source control to debug problems.\nYou don't debug by randomly trying previous versions of code. You can use\nprevious versions as a single test of your triangulated test cases. Bugs are\nnot always introduced by changes. Bugs can lie dormant in a code base for long\nperiods of time. By blindly rolling back changes, you could just be hiding a\nbug, versus fixing one.\n2.2.8 Check your fix.\nRun the triangulated test cases against your code. Have another set of eyes\nlook at your change, preferably someone who is experienced in the code.\n2.2.9 Look for similar errors.\nErrors tend to occur in groups, so check to make sure a similar mistake was not\nmade in other parts of the code.\n2.2.10 Fix the code AND the comments.\nWhen you have correct code but incorrect comments, you will confuse the next\nperson in the code. Remember, programming is a team sport.\n2.2.11 Fix the comments AND the documentation.\nThe next person to make a large change to code will thank you and might even\nnot camp out in your cube for a week. This has been simplified in EDK II by\nembedding the documentation within the comments.\n2.3 Additional Recommendations\n\nIf you have trouble debugging without violating these rules, please ask for\nhelp.\n\nLearn to debug by debugging with someone who is good at it. There is\n(approximately) a 20-to-1 difference in the time it takes an experienced\nprogrammer to find the same set of errors as an inexperienced programmer.\n\nTry to not focus only on the bug, but on the process and techniques the\nexperienced programmer uses to find bugs.\n\nWhen working with a more experienced debugger, your goal should be to improve\nyour debugging skills.\n\nIf you rely too heavily on the debugging skills of others, your own expertise\nsuffers.\n\n\n"},"3_quick_reference.html":{"url":"3_quick_reference.html","title":"3 Quick Reference","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

See \"Internal\nComments\".\n\nLocal comments must have a blank line before the comment block. See \"Internal\nComments\".\n\nComments must be indented to match the code. See \"Internal Comments\".\n\nIf a comment applies to more than one block of code, there should be a blank\nline after the comment. See \"Internal Comments\".\n\nIf a comment applies to a single block of code, there should not be a blank\nline separating the comment from the code. See \"Internal Comments\".\n\n\n3.4.1.2 Documentation: What not to comment\n\nNo comment markers are allowed in code, including:\n\nBUGBUG\nYour name\nYour initials\nSpecial markers, such as FIX_THIS, TEST . See \"What NOT to Comment\".\n\n\nUse your bug tracking system to track bugs instead of markers within the\ncode. If you really must mark the code, use Doxygen's @bug or @todo\ncommands. See \"What NOT to Comment\".\n\n\n3.4.2 Doxygen\n\nDoxygen comments are used to document global and file-scope elements. See\n\"Global Comments\".\n\nC-style comment blocks are of the form:\n/** Brief Description.\n *  ... More text ...\n*/\n\n\nC++ style comment blocks begin with ///.\n\nComments precede the semantic element they document. See \"Special\nDocumentation Blocks\".\n\nThe special form, ///, allows documentation to be after the documented\nelement. See\"Putting Documentation after Members\".\n\nComment blocks automatically start with a brief description and end at the\nfirst period. See \"Special Documentation Blocks\" .\n\nThe most frequently used Doxygen commands are: ( See \"Special Commands\").\n\n\n@file []\n@param[in, out]  { parameter description }\n@retval  { description }\n@sa { references }\n@test { description of a test case }\n\n"},"4_naming_conventions/":{"url":"4_naming_conventions/","title":"4 Naming Conventions","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The name length is just a guideline; the most important\nthing is that the name conveys a clear meaning of what it represents.\nDo not overload commonly used terms.\nFor example, EFI has an event model, so don't call some abstraction that you\ndefine an Event. People will get confused. Make sure someone reading the code\ncan tell what you are talking about.\nEach word or concept must start with a capital letter and be followed by\nlower-case letters.\nThe intent is for names to be consistent and easily readable.

The only exception is with modules that are mutually\nexclusive with these libraries. These reserved identifiers are listed in\n\"Reserved Identifiers\" and reserved keywords are listed in \"Reserved Keywords\".\n4.1.2 Common Opposites in Variable Names\nUse the correct opposites when declaring names.\nTable 1 Common Opposites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadd / remove\nbegin / end\ncreate / destroy\n\n\nincrement / decrement\nfirst / last\nget / release\n\n\nlock / unlock\nput / get\nup / down\n\n\nold / new\nmin / max\nnext / previous\n\n\nsource / destination\nopen / close\nshow / hide\n\n\n\nsource / target\nstart / stop\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Abbreviation Usage\n4.1.3.1 The use of abbreviations shall be regulated.\nThis document describes a common set of abbreviations that can be freely used.\nIf you must make up abbreviations, remember the name is most important to the\nreader of the code, not the writer.\n4.1.3.2 New abbreviations must be documented in the header of each using file.\nAny abbreviation used, which is not documented in this specification, or in the\nUEFI Specification shall be placed into a Glossary section of the File header\nas specified in See \"File Heading\".\nDo not define a new abbreviation to replace an abbreviation that is already\ndefined in this document.

Given that\nmany readers of the code may not have made the conversion to add the 'i', do\nnot use KB, MB, and GB for powers of 10 Instead, use e.g. \"2*10^6 bytes\"\ninstead of 2MB to avoid confusion. Note that GiB is derived from the G in\n'Giga', the 'i' in binary, and the B in 'Byte'.\n4.1.4 Acronym Usage\n4.1.4.1 The use of acronyms shall be limited.\nPlease remember the golden rule: Code for the person who will have to read and\nmaintain your code. Making up your own vocabulary to describe your module can\nlead to lots of confusion.\n4.1.4.2 Created Acronyms must be fully defined.\nIf you must create acronyms, they must be fully defined in the documentation\n4.1.4.2.1 Translation tables are required for each module using a created acronym\nEach module that uses the acronym must contain a translation table comment in\nthe file header. This definition is required so that others can understand your\nnames and comments.\n4.1.4.3 Industry-Standard Acronyms are allowed\nIt's okay to use acronyms for industry standards.\nAcronyms such as Pci, Acpi, Smbios, Isa, (capitalized per the variable naming\nconvention) are all legal to use without defining their meaning.\nIf you reference an industry standard acronym, the file header must define to\nwhich version of the specification the code is written. Thus, a PCI resource\nmanager would state that it was coded to follow the PCI 2.2 Specification and\nwhich optional features it included support for.\n4.1.4.4 Capitalize Acronyms in comments and documentation to match their industry standard use.\nFor example, use \"PCI\" in comments and documentation, and \"Pci\" for functions,\nfiles, etc.\nThe table below lists the acronyms that are considered integral to the EDK II\nvernacular, and may be used without defining their meaning in a comment.\nTable 3 EFI Supported Acronyms\n\n\n\nAcronyms\nIn an Identifier\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nACPI\nAcpi\nAdvanced Configuration and Power Interface\n\n\nAGP\nAgp\nAccelerated Graphics Port\n\n\nANSI\nAnsi\nAmerican National Standards Institute\n\n\nASCII\nAscii\nAmerican Standard Code for Information Interchange\n\n\nATA\nAta\nAdvanced Technology Attachment\n\n\nATAPI\nAtapi\nAdvanced Technology Attachment Packet Interface\n\n\nBFD\nBfd\nBoot Flash Device\n\n\nBIOS\nBios\nBasic Input/Output System\n\n\nBIS\nBis\nBoot Integrity Services\n\n\nCMOS\nCmos\nComplementary metal oxide semiconductor\n\n\nCPU\nCpu\nCentral processing unit\n\n\nCRC\nCrc\nCyclic Redundancy Check\n\n\nDMA\nDma\nDirect Memory Access\n\n\nDXE\nDxe\nDriver Execution Environment\n\n\nEFI\nEfi\nExtensible Firmware Interface\n\n\nFD\nFd\nFlash Device\n\n\nFIFO\nFifo\nFirst In First Out\n\n\nFV\nFv\nFirmware Volume\n\n\nGUID\nGuid\nGlobally Unique Identifier\n\n\nIEC\nIec\nInternational Electrotechnical Commission\n\n\nISA\nIsa\nIndustry Standard Architecture\n\n\nISO\nIso\nInternational Standards Organization\n\n\nNVRAM\nNvram\nNonvolatile Random Access Memory\n\n\nPCI\nPci\nPeripheral Component Interconnect\n\n\nPEI\nPei\nPre-EFI Initialization environment\n\n\nRAM\nRam\nRandom Access Memory\n\n\nROM\nRom\nRead-Only Memory\n\n\nSRAM\nSram\nStatic Random Access Memory\n\n\nTPL\nTpl\nTask Priority Level\n\n\nUEFI\nUefi\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface\n\n\nUNDI\nUndi\nUniversal Network Driver Interface\n\n\nUSB\nUsb\nUniversal Serial Bus\n\n\nVGA\nVga\nVideo graphics array\n\n\n\n"},"4_naming_conventions/42_file_names.html":{"url":"4_naming_conventions/42_file_names.html","title":"4.2 File Names","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The ISO standard only guarantees that language\nprocessors only pay attention to the first 31 symbols when comparing\nidentifiers. Note that the same ISO standard requires that external labels\n(those visible to the linker) be unique in their first six characters. Since it\nhas been confirmed that 31 character / case significance is supported by EDK II\nsupported tool chains, there is no requirement to ensure uniqueness of\nexternals within the first 6 characters.\n4.3.2 Always make identifier names that are visually distinguishable.\nWhile not as big an issue as it has been in the past, when choosing labels\nensure that the label is unlikely to be confused with other labels used in the\nfile. Ensure that long label names vary by more than one or two characters.\nEnsure that labels don't vary between zero and oh (0 and O), one and ell (1 and\nl). Some also consider 2 and Z, and 5 and S to be similar.\n4.3.3 Hungarian Prefixes\n4.3.3.1 Use of Hungarian notation is not allowed\nThis set of detailed guidelines for naming variables and routines is a\nconvention widely used with the C programming language, especially in\nMicrosoft Windows programming. An example of a non-compliant variable named\nwith the Hungarian conventions follows:\nbmRequestType;  // Byte mask, First byte in the USB message header\npachInsert;     // A pointer to an array of characters to insert.\nGlobal data and module data shall be prefixed with 'g' or 'm', respectively.\nPointer variables may optionally be prefixed with 'p'. These are the only\nexceptions to the prohibition against Hungarian notation.\n4.3.3.2 Any variable with file scope, or better, shall be prefixed by an 'm' or 'g'\nThere are no exceptions to this rule. The 'm' prefix identifies a variable\nwith module scope, while a 'g' prefix identifies a global variable.\ngThisIsAGlobalVariableName\nmThisIsAModuleVariableName\n4.3.3.3 Pointer variables may optionally be prefixed with a 'p'\nTime has shown that pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference errors are\nsignificantly reduced with only the introduction of a 'p' prefix for pointer\nvariables.\n4.3.3.4 Reasons use of Hungarian prefixes not allowed\nThe abstraction of abstract data types is ignored. Instead, base types based on\nprogramminglanguage integers or long integers are abstracted. Thus, the names\nare focused on data types instead of the object-oriented abstraction that they\nrepresent. This focus is of little value and forces manual type checking that\ncan be accomplished easily by the compiler with warnings promoted to errors.\nHungarian notation combines data meaning with data representation. If you\nchange a data type you have to rename the variable. There is no mechanism to\nensure that the names are accurate.\nStudies have shown that Hungarian notation tends to encourage lazy variable\nnames. It's common to focus on the Hungarian prefix without putting effort into\na descriptive name.\n4.3.4 Function and Data Names\n4.3.4.1 Identifiers shall contain mixed upper- and lower-case text.\nUse of all upper- or all lower-case is very difficult to read because compound\nwords cannot be clearly separated.\n4.3.4.2 The names of newly created global entities (such as structures, macros, and defines) shall not use an EFI_ prefix.\nFrom now on, the use of DXE_ and PEI_ prefixes shall be reserved for DXE and\nPEI drivers, respectively. If a structure happens to apply equally to PEI and\nDXE, it should use the prefix DXE_. If a structure is local to a particular\nmodule only, no special prefix is required.\n4.3.4.3 Acronyms are not capitalized in Function and Data Names.\nWhen all letters in an acronym are capitalized, it makes the prior and\nsubsequent words visually difficult to distinguish.\nThisIsAnExampleOfWhatToDoForPci\n4.3.4.4 Never use C keywords or the names of symbols declared in the standard header files as internal symbols.\nWhen you need to use the name of an existing library function for a\nuser-defined function, each use of the user-defined function must be paired\nwith a corresponding comment. The ISO standard does not, however, guarantee\nthat the user-defined function will take priority over the library function.\n4.3.4.4.1 List of the C-reserved keywords.\nIn principle, the ISO standard, reserves all names beginning with underscore +\ncapital letter, or with underscore + underscore.

This may not be sufficient\nfor header files that don't have a unique name. In that case, additional text\nmay have to be added to the macro name in order to make it unique.

Technically, both global and module variables are defined at file\nscope with external linkage. A module variable is intended to only be accessed\nacross a small set of related routines that have strict rules for accessing the\ndata; in effect, constrained to the set of files described within a single .inf\nfile. A global variable is intended to be accessed throughout the firmware,\nusually indirectly through a protocol pointer or similar mechanism.\nThis is important when the time comes to maintain a module. A module variable\nshould be fairly safe and easy to change because it is only accessed from a\nsmall number of routines. On the other hand, a global variable is accessed\nthroughout the firmware and as the firmware evolves more code will tend to\naccess the data resulting in a large number of uses to track down.\n4.4.1 Recommendations for Global and Module Variables\n4.4.1.1 The use of global and module data is strongly discouraged.\nGlobal variables are appropriate for GUID, protocol, PPI definitions and other\nimmutable objects. Attempting to create global variables can cause many\nproblems, including: increased image size and variables actually residing in\nROM.\nThe use of global and module variables may be appropriate for solving certain\nprogramming issues. A module is defined to be a set of data and routines that\nact on that data. Thus, in EFI a protocol could be thought of as a module. A\ncomplicated protocol may be built out of several smaller modules.\n4.4.1.2 Use locking to protect access to global and module variables.\nThis protection is strongly encouraged and especially useful for data that is\naccessed at various task priority levels.\n"},"4_naming_conventions/45_name_space_rules.html":{"url":"4_naming_conventions/45_name_space_rules.html","title":"4.5 Name Space Rules","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The same\nname could be used in a separate name space for a completely different item.\nName spaces are defined as:\n\nlabel names\ntags of structures, unions and enumerators\nMembers of structures or unions\nAll other identifiers.\n\n\nNote: Name space and scope are not synonymous. Name space rules do not\napply to scope. Scope is described in \"Scoping Rules\".\n\n4.5.1 Names shall be used consistently within the same type.\nFor example, structure tags may only be reused as structure types, and union\ntags may be reused only for union types.\ntypedef struct MyStruct {\n  int  one;\n  int  two;\n  int  three;\n} MY_STRUCT;\n\nBecause of the similarity of MyStruct to MY_STRUCT, they may only be used\nto refer to the same structure type.\n4.5.2 No identifier in one name space may be reused as an identifier in another name space\nExceptions are structure member and union member names.\ntypedef struct StructOne {\n  INT32             one;\n  INT16             two;\n  struct StructOne  *MySelf;\n} STRUCT_ONE;\n\ntypedef struct StructTwo {\n  INT16             one;\n  INT8              *two;\n  struct StructTwo  *MySelf;\n} STRUCT_TWO;\n\ntypedef struct {\n  STRUCT_ONE  *StructOne;     // NOT ALLOWED\n  STRUCT_TWO  *StructTwoPtr;  // ALLOWED, it is unique\n} BAD_STRUCT;\n\n4.5.3 A typedef name shall be a unique identifier.\nThe name that appears at the end of a typedef (STRUCT_ONE and STRUCT_TWO in\nthe example in Section 4.5.2) is known as a typedef name. Because of ambiguity\nin the C specifications, and to avoid confusion, and once a typedef name is used\nin a structure declaration, it may not be declared elsewhere\n\nNote: Including the declaration in a header file that is then included in a\nnumber of files is not a violation of this rule.\n\n4.5.4 A tag name shall be unique.\nThe name after the struct in structure definitions (StructOne and\nStructTwo in the example in 4.5.2) is known as a structure tag or simply a\ntag. To avoid confusion, once a tag is used for declaring a structure it\nshall not be declared elsewhere.\n\nNote: Including a header file that contains a structure definition is not a\nviolation of this rule.\n\n4.5.5 Prefix module-scope identifiers for cleaner namespaces.\nThe use of prefixes is not an absolute requirement, but has been shown as a\nsuccessful method of avoiding namespace pollution and makes it easier to meet\nother naming requirements. A useful prefix is the module's name. For example,\nthe UEFI Shell uses the prefix \"Shell\" for its identifiers.\nSHELL_FREE_NON_NULL (Buffer);\nShellCommandLibConstructor (ImageHandle, SystemTable);\n"},"5_source_files/":{"url":"5_source_files/","title":"5 Source Files","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

In particular, do not be tempted to use the zero prefix in\ntables of numbers to ensure visual alignment:\nAddress[0] = 00130;  // Decimal 88\nAddress[1] = 01450;  // Decimal 808\nAddress[3] = 81200;  // Decimal 81200\n\n5.1.6 Only use CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) line endings.\nUse Windows, or MSDOS, style line endings.

The first two characters\nare \"??\" while the third character disambiguates the trigraph. Technically\ntherefore, a[5] could be written a??(5??). Trigraphs have provided both\nconfusing and unnecessary and are prohibited.\n5.1.9 In-line assembler shall not be used\nThere are really no reasons for in-line assembler to be used in EDK II code.\nThe only exceptions in this case are largely associated with the lowest level\nArchitectural Protocols. Using in-line assembly language deviates against the\nScope rules defined in Section 1.3 \"Scope\" because it is an extension to\nstandard C. This.\n5.1.10 Do not use #pragma, except for #pragma pack (#).\nThe only other exception for this would be in the ProcessorBind.h file.\n"},"5_source_files/52_spacing.html":{"url":"5_source_files/52_spacing.html","title":"5.2 Spacing","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The\nuniqueness test applies to the entire path used in the #include directive. For\nexample:\n#include \n#include \"Olive/Pit.h\"\n#include \n#include \"OpenPit.h\"\nThese are unique, even if the file name itself is not, as long as the preceding\npath component is included.\nTo see why this is necessary, consider a package, FruitPkg, that has the\nfollowing in its DEC file:\n[Includes]\n  Include\n  Include/Olive\n  Include/Peach\n\nBoth the Include/Olive and Include/Peach directories contain a file Pit.h.\nIt then becomes ambiguous which file is being referenced if one encounters\n#include  in a source file. This ambiguity would be compounded if\nanother package, also dependent upon FruitPkg, contained a Pit.h file in its\nInclude directory.\nExisting automatically generated include files, such as AutoGen.h, are\nexempted from this rule. It is not mandatory to rename pre-existing include\nfiles.\nUnique file names may also be formed by appending or prepending a short\ncharacter sequence, such as the module or package name in which the file\nresides, or an abbreviation of one of these, to the file name.\nPeachPit.h OlivePit.h MoneyPit.h PitBoss.h\n5.3.3 Include files shall not consist mainly of include directives.\nThis type of omnibus header file can significantly increase the time required\nto rebuild a project. If any of the included files changes, every file that\nincludes the omnibus file will have to be recompiled; even if that particular\nfile did not use the changed header file.\n5.3.4 Include files may include only those headers that it directly depends upon.\nThis maintains proper dependency relationships between the files and allows the\nheader file to be used without prior knowledge of its dependencies.\n5.3.5 All include file contents must be protected by a #include guard.\nAlso known as a \"macro guard\", use #include guards to avoid multiple inclusions\nwhen dealing with the include directive. Adding #include guards to a header\nfile makes that file idempotent.\n#ifndef FILE_NAME_H_\n#define FILE_NAME_H_\n...\n#endif // FILE_NAME_H_\n\nAvoid duplicating the guard macro name in different header files. Including a\nduplicate guard macro name prevents the symbols in the other from being\ndefined. Names starting with one or two underscores, such as\n_MACRO_GUARD_FILE_NAME_H_, must not be used. They are reserved for compiler\nimplementation.\nWith modern programming practices, particularly include files including other\ninclude files, it is almost impossible to avoid including the same file more\nthan once. This can only slow down the processing time and may cause difficult\nto diagnose issues. To avoid this, the use of macro guards is required in all\ninclude files to protect against inadvertent multiple inclusion.\n\nThe #ifndef shall be on the first line following the file header comment.\nThis location ensures that all code is contained.\n\nThe #endif shall appear as the last line in the file.  The #endif is\nfollowed by a comment consisting solely of the guard token. The line shall end\nwith a carriage return (new line) as the last thing in the file, thus ensuring\nthat all code is contained.\n\n\n5.3.6 Include files shall contain only public or only private data.\nInclude files must not contain both types of information. Examples of public\ninclude files would be protocol definitions or industry standard specifications\n(EFI, SAL, ACPI, SMBIOS, etc.). Private data would include functions and\ninternal data structure declarations used only within a single module.\n5.3.7 Include files shall not generate code or define data variables.\nIncluding code or defining variables can result in issues that are very\ndifficult to debug.\nThe sample below shows the suggested order of declarations in an include file.\nNot all types of declarations are present in every file.\n/** @file\n  Public declarations of bizarre protocols for something.\n\n  This is a detailed description of the something for which this\n  file exists.

The various\nidentifier scopes encountered are: file, prototype, function, and block or\nlocal scope.\nFile Scope\nTop-level identifiers and preprocessor macros are said to have file scope.\nTheir scope extends from their declaration point to the end of the source\nprogram file. A preprocessor macro can go out-of-scope earlier if a #undef\ncommand that cancels its definition is encountered.\nPrototype Scope\nThe identifiers making up the formal parameters in function prototypes have\nprototype scope. Identifiers with prototype scope have scopes extending from\ntheir declaration point to the end of the prototype.\nFunction Scope\nStatement labels have function scope. Function scope identifiers have scope\nwhich encompasses the entire function body in which they appear. This means\nthat statement labels can be referenced before they are declared.\nBlock (local) Scope\nFormal parameters in function definitions and data defined within compound\nstatements have block scope. Any group of statements that are encompassed\nwithin a pair of braces, { }, is a compound statement. The body of a function\nis also a compound statement. Compound statements can be nested, with each\ncreating a new scope.\nData declarations may follow the opening brace of a compound statement,\nregardless of nesting depth, and before any code generating statements have\nbeen entered. Other than at the outermost block of a function body, this type\nof declaration is strongly discouraged.\n\nNote: Visual C++ gives all structure declarations File Scope, even though\nISO/IEC 9899 specifies that structure declarations may have Block Scope.\n\n5.4.1.2 Visibility\nA declaration of an identifier is visible in some context if a use of the\nidentifier in that context is associated with that declaration. A declaration\nmight be visible throughout its scope, but it might also be hidden by other\ndeclarations whose scope and visibility overlap that of the first declaration.\n5.4.1.2.1 No two different identifiers in a function may have the same name nor may any of the names in a function be the same as those declared at a global or module level.\n\nIdentifiers with file scope have the outermost scope. Those with block scope\nhave the innermost scope. Nesting successive blocks creates more inner scopes.\n\nOnly disallow instances where an outer definition is hidden by a second inner\ndefinition. This rule is not violated when the first definition is not hidden\nby the second definition.\n\n\nThe following example shows how the scope visibility of identifiers can overlap\nand hide each other. Never write code that does this.\n 1 UINTN MyVar = 7; // File scope\n 2\n 3 VOID\n 4 MyFunction (\n 5   OUT UINT32 *MyVar // Function scope\n 6   )\n 7 {\n 8   UINT32 i;\n 9\n10   for ( i = 0; i In the above example, there are three declarations of MyVar:\n\nOn line 1, MyVar is defined with file scope and value 7 This scope extends\nfrom line 1 through line 26.\n\nOn line 5, MyVar is declared as a formal parameter of MyFunction. Its\ncontext extends from line 5 through the end of the function on line 18.\n\nOn line 11, MyVar is declared with block scope. From its declaration point\non line 11 through the end of the block in which it was declared, this\ndeclaration of MyVar will be in scope. It is initialized to the current\nvalue of i.\n\n\nTo test yourself on your understanding of scope and visibility rules, determine\nthe value and associated declaration for each use of MyVar before reading\nfurther.\nThe first use of MyVar is on line 14 Its associated declaration is on line 11\nEach time through the for loop it will have the values 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'\nin succession.\nOn line 15, MyVar is used again with its associated declaration on line 11\nwith the same succession of values assigned as on line 14.\nMyVar, on line 17, associates with the formal parameter declaration on line 5\nIn this case the value of i, which is 5, is stored in the location MyVar\npoints to. The location is established in the call to MyFunction on line 24.\nThe last use of MyVar occurs on line 25 This occurrence associates with the\ndeclaration on line 1 and has the value 7.\nThings get extremely tricky on line 12 The identifier i, which is the control\nvariable for the enclosing for loop, is declared with a different type and\nvalue. It is ambiguous as to which i was wanted in line 11. How does this\naffect the for loop? What will be the value of i at lines 15 and 17?\nThe scope rules tell us the answers, but they still aren't obvious.\n\nThe i on line 10 is outside the block, which is the body of the for loop.\nIt associates with the declaration on line 8, so the for loop will continue\nto work as expected.\n\nOn line 11, MyVar will be initialized to the current value of i. It is\ncompiler dependent whether this is the first value of i, 0, or the value of\ni for each loop.\n\nLine 12 declares a new variable i which is given the value 12 C scoping\nrules state that a scope begins at the declaration point, not at the beginning\nof the block in which the declaration appears. Because of this, the i used\non line 11 is not the same i declared here.\n\nThe value of i used on line 15 is 12, the value of the associated and\ncurrently visible identifier with that name.\n\n\nAs you can see, using the same identifier at different scopes can be confusing\nat best. All it takes is one mistake and a bug is introduced that is very hard\nto locate.\n5.4.1.3 Compile-Time Names\nSo far we have been talking about variable and function identifiers, which have\nan existence at run time. However, the scope and visibility rules apply equally\nto identifiers applied to objects that don't necessarily exist at run time:\ntypedef names, type tags, enumeration constants, macros, and labels.\nMacros and labels follow the rules outlined for them in Section 5.4.1.1 \"Scope\".\nThe other compile-time names follow the same scope and visibility rules as any\nvariable defined at the same location.\n5.4.2 Storage Class\n5.4.2.1 extern\nA special case of scope and visibility is the external identifier, also\ncalled an identifier with external linkage. All instances of an external\nidentifier, among all the files making up a C module, are forced to refer to\nthe same object or function. Each instance of the external identifier must be\ndeclared with the same type in each file or else the result is undefined.\nExternal names are declared using the extern keyword. In C89, and earlier\ndialects, external identifiers declared at file scope are implicitly extern.\nBut, not all identifiers declared extern were external.\nThe compilers supported by EDK II follow the C99 specification for extern. All\ndeclarations of the external variable must use the extern keyword. There must\nbe a single definition of the external variable which does not use the extern\nkeyword. This definition may also include an initializer.\nBy convention, external names are declared at the top level of a C program and\ntherefore have file scope. For EDK II, external names must be declared in a\nsingle header file and must be defined at the top level of a C file as\nspecified in Section 5.4.1.3 \"Compile-Time Names\".\nThus, while it might be legal C, do not declare external variables anywhere\nother than at the top level of a file as specified by this document.\n5.4.2.2 Static\nAn object declared STATIC has either file or block scope.\n5.4.2.2.1 Do not reuse an object or function identifier with static storage duration.\nThroughout the set of source files defined within a single .inf file, do not\nreuse an identifier with static storage duration. The compiler may not be\nconfused by this, but the user may confuse unrelated variables with the same\nname.\n5.4.2.2.2 Functions should not be declared STATIC.\nSome source-level debuggers are unable to resolve static functions. Until it\ncan be verified that no one is dependent upon a debugger with this limitation,\nit is strongly recommended that functions not be declared static.\n"},"5_source_files/55_preprocessor_directives.html":{"url":"5_source_files/55_preprocessor_directives.html","title":"5.5 Preprocessor Directives","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

A file name delimited by angle\nbrackets, , indicates that the compiler should search the default\ninclude paths and those specified by '-I' directives on the compiler command\nline (System Include Files). If one uses double quotes to delimit the file\nname, \"FileName.h\", the compiler will first search the directory containing\nthe file being compiled before then searching the System include paths.\nThe general rule to be derived from this is that one should use double quotes\nto include files in the same directory as, or a subdirectory of, the file being\ncompiled, and angle brackets for all other include files.\n#include  /* System include file. */\n#include \"SampleThing.h\" /* In same directory as the C file. */\n\n5.5.1.2 Include file paths shall be relative and shall not contain \"..\" elements.\nAll include paths must be relative to either the current .c file, or a\npredefined include directory.\n5.5.2 Macros\n5.5.2.1 Functional macros are generally discouraged.\nParameterized macros are difficult to debug, have difficult syntax, do not\nencourage strong commenting, and generally negatively impact maintainability\nand understandability of code. Macros are appropriate for some concepts, such\nas containment records and include path abstraction.\n5.5.2.2 Macros follow the standard data naming conventions used by typedef and #define.\nThe main reason for making a macro different from a function is the difference\nin the order of precedence that can occur between poorly constructed macros and\nfunctions.\n5.5.2.3 Overusing parentheses is strongly encouraged.\nAn order-of-precedence bug in a macro is very hard to debug. The following are\nexamples of macro construction:\n#define BAD_MACRO(a, b) a*b\n#define GOOD_MACRO(a, b) ((a)*(b))\nThe following examples should explain the difference between BAD_MACRO () and\nGOOD_MACRO ():\n\nBAD_MACRO (10, 2) and GOOD_MACRO (10, 2) both evaluate to 20.\n\nBAD_MACRO (7+3, 2) returns 13 = 7 + (3*2).\n\nGOOD_MACRO (7+3, 2) returns 20.\n\n\nAlso, consider the following expression:\n8 | 8 == 8\nOn first glance, one might think that the expression would evaluate to TRUE.\nThis is not the case. The bitwise OR operator, '|', has lower precedence than\nthe equality operator, '=='. This results in the expression being evaluated as\nif one had entered:\n8 | ( 8 == 8 )\nThis evaluates to the value 9 The desired result of TRUE, (1), can be achieved\nby specifying the expression as:\n((8 | 8) == 8)\n5.5.2.4 Macros must have comment blocks like functions.\nMacros can be very difficult to debug, so explicit descriptions of the input,\noutput, and behavior are required. This is true whether it is a parameterized\nor a simple substitution macro.\n5.5.2.5 Parameterized macro definitions shall not have a space between the name and the '(.'\nFailure to do this will cause the build to break.\n#define GOOD_MACRO(a, b) ((a)*(b))\nThis is because the compiler has no way to differentiate between\n#define SIMPLE_MACRO (a) (TXT)\nwhich substitutes all subsequent occurrences of SIMPLE_MACRO with (a) (TXT), and\n#define PARAM_MACRO(a) (a) (TXT)\nwhich defines a parameterized macro.\n5.5.2.6 When using a macro, there must be a space between the name and the '(' to comply with function calling conventions.\nFailure to separate macro names from parameters negatively impacts readability\nand consistency with other coding style rules.\nGOOD_MACRO (7+3, 2)\n5.5.2.7 Single-line Functions\nMost uses of parameterized macros can be replaced by one or two line functions.\nThe compilers will almost always in-line the function resulting in the same\neffect as the parameterized macro.

Per the UEFI\nSpecification, version 2.3.1:\n\"Unless otherwise specified, all data types are naturally aligned. Structures\nare aligned on boundaries equal to the largest internal datum of the structure,\nand internal data is implicitly padded to achieve natural alignment.\"\nTable 6 EFI Data Types (slightly modified from UEFI 2.3.1)\n\n\n\nMnemonic\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nBOOLEAN\nLogical Boolean. 1-byte value containing a 0 for False or a 1 for True.

The IN, OUT, OPTIONAL, and UNALIGNED\nmodifiers are used only to qualify arguments to a function. They should never\nappear in a data type declaration. The EFIAPI modifier is used to ensure the\ncorrect calling convention is used between different modules that are not linked\ntogether. Use this modifier at the entry of drivers, events, and member\nfunctions of protocols.\nThe EFIAPI modifier must be used for all UEFI defined API functions, as well\nas for any function that takes a variable number of arguments. All protocol\nfunctions as well as public functions exposed by drivers must also be declared\nEFIAPI. This establishes a common calling convention for functions that could\nbe referenced by other code that has potentially been built using a different\ncompiler, with a different native calling convention.\nTable 7 Modifiers for Common EFI Data Types (reference the UEFI Specification and Beyond Bios)\n\n\n\nMnemonic\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nIN\nDatum is passed to the function.\n\n\nOUT\nDatum is returned from the function.\n\n\nOPTIONAL\nDatum that is passed to the function is optional, and a NULL may be passed if the value is not supplied.\n\n\nUNALIGNED\nDatum is byte packed and is not naturally aligned.\n\n\nVOLATILE\nDeclares a variable to be volatile and thus exempt from optimization to remove redundant or unneeded accesses. Any variable that represents a hardware device should be declared as VOLATILE.\n\n\nCONST\nDeclares a variable to be of type const. This type is a hint to the compiler to enable optimization and stronger type checking at compile time.\n\n\nEFIAPI\nDefines the calling convention for EFI interfaces. All EFI intrinsic services and any member function of a protocol must use this modifier on the function definition.\n\n\n\n5.6.2 Constants\n5.6.2.1 EFI Constants\n\"EFI Constants\" below lists the EFI constants that should be used to represent\ncertain concepts.\nTable 8 EFI Constants\n\n\n\nMnemonic\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nTRUE\nOne = ( 1 TRUE.\n\n\nFALSE\nZero = ( 2 \n\n\nNULL\nVOID pointer to zero.

It is also\nrecommended that the enum members be named carefully, such that their names\nwould not tend to collide with other variable or function names.\ntypedef enum {\n  EnumMemberOne,  ///\nThis obviously will not work if values are explicitly assigned out-of-sequence\nor are duplicated.\n\nAll constants that will be used \"as is\" should be declared as enums.\nAn enum does not cause code to be generated until the enum is used, whereas a\nconst int will cause space for the int to be allocated as well as the code\ngenerated whenever the int is used. The use of enums allows type checking to\nbe performed, while the use of macros does not.\n\n\n5.6.2.3 Macro Constants\nConstants that will be used to construct other values should be declared as\nmacros.  These include bit field definitions and masks.\n5.6.2.4 Pointers and Constants\nThere are three different ways pointers and constants can interact:\n\nPointer to Constant:\nCONST UINTN * PointerToConst;\nPointerToConst is a variable pointer to a constant UINTN.\n\nConstant pointer to variable:\nUINTN * CONST ConstPointer;\nConstPointer is a constant pointer to a variable UINTN.\n\nConstant pointer to constant:\nCONST UINTN * CONST ConstPointerToConst;\nConstPointerToConst is a constant pointer to a constant UINTN.\n\n\n5.6.3 Structure Declaration\nStructures shall be declared as a typedef with one of two different styles\ndepending on the use of the structure. If the structure is not\nself-referential, or there is no forward reference to it, the structure may be\ndefined anonymously; see Section \"Structure Reference\".\nThis anonymous definition is valid because we typedef the structure in the\ndefinition.\n\nThe structure name and typedef name shall follow the type and macro naming\nconventions in \"Type and Macro Names\" on page 24`\n\nStructure instances: Variables, parameters, members, etc., must follow the\nfile, function, and data naming conventions in \"Identifiers\" through\n\"Name Space Rules\".\n\nStructures are always defined in a typedef struct name {...} type; format.\n\n\nThe \"name\" tag is allowed only if the structure is self-referential or the\ntarget of a forward reference.\n5.6.3.1 Structures shall not be directly declared.\nThe following are not allowed:\nstruct name {...}; // OK if object of forward reference\nstruct {...} variable; // Never OK\nstruct name {...} variable; // Never OK\n5.6.3.2 Structure Declaration with Forward Reference or Self-Reference\n/// Sample forward declaration of a structure.\ntypedef struct EFI_STRUCT_NAME EFI_STRUCT_NAME;\n\n/// Sample self-referential structure declaration.\ntypedef struct EFI_STRUCTURE_NAME {\n  ...\n  struct EFI_STRUCTURE_NAME *StructPointer;  ///\n5.6.3.3 Structure Declaration without Forward Reference\n/** Brief description of sample structure declaration.\n  *\n  * Detailed description of purpose and use of this structure.\n**/\ntypedef struct {\n  Atype  memberOne;  ///\n5.6.3.4 Bit Fields\nA member of a structure or union may be declared to consist of a specified\nnumber of bits (including a sign bit, if any).

Unnamed bit-fields are useful for padding to conform to externally\nimposed layouts.\nSpecifying a bit-field with a width of 0 (zero) indicates that no further\nbit-fields are to be packed into the unit in which the previous bit-field, if\nany, was placed.\n5.6.3.4.1 Visual C++ Specific\n\nThe alignment requirement for each non-bit-field member is the same as the\nlargest alignment requirement of the members. Thus, every member will have\nthe same alignment.\n\nA \"plain\" int bit-field is treated as a signed int bit field.\n\nBit fields are allocated within a storage unit from least-significant to\nmost-significant bit.\n\n\n5.6.3.4.2 GCC Specific\n\nThe alignment requirement for non-bit-field members of structures is\ndetermined by the target ABI.\n\nBy default, a \"plain\" int bit-field is treated as a signed int, but this\nmay be changed by the '-funsigned-bitfields' option.\n\nThe order of allocation of bit-fields within a unit is determined by the\ntarget ABI.\n\n\n"},"5_source_files/57_c_programming.html":{"url":"5_source_files/57_c_programming.html","title":"5.7 C Programming","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

For example, the first term in an OR expression that evaluates to\nTRUE is sufficient to determine that the entire OR expression will be TRUE.\nThe following code sample consists of a predicate expression within a for loop.\nThe predicate expression is a compound AND expression with four terms.

Considering that\nthere will be 25,170 PERF_END invocations one can see how the savings add up to\na sizable amount: around 2.7 seconds if the string comparisons only took 100ns\neach.\n5.7.3 Flow Control Statements\n5.7.3.1 The body of looping statements must be compound statements.\nThe if, for, do, and while statements shall use a compound statement as\ntheir bodies, even if it is necessary to use a null compound.\n5.7.3.2 Null compound statements shall occupy three source lines.\nThe opening brace shall be on the same line as the controlling keyword,\nfollowed by a line consisting of a properly indented semicolon, then closed\nwith a closing brace, aligned in the same column as the opening keyword, as the\nfirst non-white-space character on the third line.\n5.7.3.3 Any loop that contains no code in the body must use a null compound statement as the body.\nFor example, the following statement has a null compound for its body.\nfor (Index = 0; Index \nAvoid this type of construct because it is harder to read than other control\nstructures.\n5.7.3.4 if Statements\n5.7.3.4.1 The if statement shall be followed by a space and then the open parenthesis.\n\nThe open parenthesis is followed by a conditional (predicate) expression and\na close parenthesis.\n\nThere is a space after the close parenthesis followed by an open brace.\n\nThe code body follows and is indented by two spaces.\n\nThe close bracket is on its own line and indented to the same level as the if.\n\n\nThe following is the allowed if construct:\nif (TRUE) {\n  IamTheCode ();\n}\n\n5.7.3.4.2 When an else is used, it may start on the same line as the close brace of the if, or be on the following line and aligned with the closing brace.\n\nA single space must separate else from the close and open braces.\n\nAn open brace always follows the else.\n\n\nThe following are the allowed if and else constructs:\nif (EXPR_1) {\n  IamTheCode ();\n} else if (EXPR_2) {\n  IamTheCode ();\n}\nelse { // Alternative format\n  IamTheCode ();\n}\n\n5.7.3.5 while and do - while Statements\nwhile statements execute their body zero or more times depending upon the\nresult of a predicate expression. The expression is evaluated at the beginning\nof the loop and the body is executed if the expression evaluates to TRUE. Code\nmust be constructed so that nothing outside of the while loop is dependent upon\nthe body of the loop having been executed.\nwhile (TRUE) {\n  IamTheCode ();\n}\n\nFor those cases where the body of the loop must be executed at least once,\nthere is the do-while statement. In this statement, the predicate is evaluated\nat the end of the loop, with the statement's body being re-executed as long as\nthe predicate evaluates to TRUE.\ndo {\n  IamTheCode ();\n} while (TRUE);\n\n5.7.3.6 for Statements\nA for loop occupies a minimum of three lines. It is comprised of the for\nkeyword followed by three expressions within parentheses, followed by a\ncompound statement. The three expressions within parentheses are separated by\nsemicolons, ';', and consist of the initialization, conditional, and increment\nexpressions. Any one or combination of these expressions may be omitted if\nneeded.\nfor (Index = 0; Index \n5.7.3.7 switch Statements\nThe following is a switch statement:\nswitch (Variable) {\ncase 1:\n  IamTheCode ();\n  break;\n\ncase 2:\n  IamTheCode ();\n  break;\n\ndefault:\n  IamTheCode ();\n  break;\n};\n\nThe case statements are indented either zero tab stops or one tab stop and the\nbodies of each case one tab stop from the case.\nThe closing brace of the switch statement should be in the same column as the\n's' in the switch keyword.\nAlways include the default case. It should always end with a break\nstatement, even if the break is the last thing before the closing brace.\nThe indenting of the case statements should be consistent with all other\nfiles in the module containing the new .c file. Use the legacy, zero indent,\nstyle if any other file within the module uses that style, otherwise you may\nindent a single tab stop.\nA descriptive comment is required in cases where the intention is for a\npreceding case to fall through to the next case. That is to say, a\ndescriptive comment is required where there is no break preceding the second\nor beyond case in a switch block.\n5.7.3.8 Goto Statements should not be used (in general)\nIn almost all cases, it is possible to write the code so that a goto is not\nneeded. If a goto is used, be ready to defend it during review.\nIt is common to use goto for error handling and thus, exiting a routine in an\nerror case is the only legal use of a goto. A goto allows the error exit\ncode to be contained in one place in the routine. This one place reduces\nsoftware life cycle maintenance issues, as there can be one copy of error\ncleanup code per routine.\nThe goto follows the normal rules for C code. The label must be indented one\nlevel less than the code it is marking.\nStatus = IAmTheCode ();\nif (EFI_ERROR (Status)) {\n  goto ErrorExit;\n}\n\nIDoTheWork ();\n\nErrorExit:\n  return Status;\n\nThe above example could have been rewritten as below, eliminating the need for\na goto.\nStatus = IAmTheCode ();\nif (! EFI_ERROR (Status)) {\n  IDoTheWork ();\n}\nreturn Status;\n\n5.7.4 Structure Definitions\n5.7.4.1 Structure Reference\n/** Sample reference to a structure.\n *\n * Sample code showing a reference to a structure as a\n * function parameter. This function should be called as:\n * FooName (&Structure);\n *\n * @param[in] Arg1 A pointer to the sample structure.\n**/\nVOID\nEFIAPI\nFooName (\n  IN EFI_STRUCTURE_NAME  *Arg1\n  );\n\nIn any situation, definition of structure instances shall be in the following\nform:\nEFI_STRUCTURE_NAME  StructureName;\nNever pass structures as function parameters by value. Use the \"address of\"\noperator, '&', and pass structures by reference.\nFooName (&StructureName);\n"},"5_source_files/58_error_handling_and_assert.html":{"url":"5_source_files/58_error_handling_and_assert.html","title":"5.8 Error Handling and ASSERT","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

In this sense it is a kind of publication.\nHowever, the machine is concerned with whether the program compiles, while\npeople are necessarily concerned about coding conventions or style.\nSensible and consistently applied typographic (stylistic) conventions are\nimportant to the creation of a clear presentation. Conventions are created to\nfacilitate clarity, should not become an end in and of themselves. As Rob Pike\npoints out, we should avoid typographic silliness and decoration:\" . . . keep\ncomments brief and banner free. Say what you want to say in the program, neatly\nand consistently. Then move on.\"\n6.1.1 Requirements\nThe EDK II code documentation shall fulfill the following main functions:\n6.1.1.1 Instruction\nIt shall serve as:\n\nWorking instructions (e.g. error and interrupt handling, data archiving, ...)\n\nA working basis to avoid duplication of work\n\nA working basis for software maintenance (e.g. updates, upgrades,\ntroubleshooting)\n\nA basis for brief instruction and training of new staff members; simple\ntraining courses\n\n\n6.1.1.2 Verification, Validation, and Objective Evidence\n\nEstablishes traceability between the code and product requirements\n\nReference for internal and external auditors (product liability, ISO 9001\ncertification)\n\nFacilitates project management and monitoring\n\nIncreases testability of the software\n\n\n6.1.1.3 Communications\n\nEstablishes an uniform communication basis for:\n\nAll software developers\n\nContractors and customers\n\nIncreases software re-usability\n\nIncreases transparency of the software\n\n\n6.1.2 Interfaces or Protocols\nThe EDK II architecture forces explicit documentation as it encourages the use\nof multiple, independent modules. The mechanism for these modules to\ncommunicate is a protocol. A protocol is an instance of an API (a class in C++\nvernacular) that is named by a GUID. The GUID defines the data representation\nand member functions of a protocol. Any change to the behavior of a protocol\nrequires the GUID to change. Given this property, each protocol used in EDK II\nmust have an interface document.\n"},"6_documenting_software/62_comments.html":{"url":"6_documenting_software/62_comments.html","title":"6.2 Comments","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

One\nshould assume that others reading the code know the implementation language.\nCode that is clear, using good type and variable names, should be\nself-explanatory - at a micro level. Comments should explain the\nless-than-obvious aspects of the code, at a macro level.\n\nNote: The comments need to explain why things were done and the big picture\nof how something works and the ways in which the various pieces relate to each\nother.\n\nBy definition, misleading comments can cause confusion. When you modify code,\nyou should always check the comments to ensure that they accurately document\nthe modified code. Comments are not checked by the compiler, and are therefore\nnot guaranteed to be correct. Comments are even more of a risk following code\nmodification.\nWrite your comments assuming that they are going to be read by someone with\nminimal familiarity with the code. Clarity is important, but one should also\nstrive for terse and concise comments. One should be able to see both the\ncomment, and the code being commented on, on the same screen.\n6.2.1 Only use C style, \"/*\", comments for multi-line comments and on the same line as pre-processor directives.\nCompile can vary in their support for use of // in preprocessor directives\n(e.g. #define). Note that the mixing of /* ... */ and // is not handled\nconsistently. This goes beyond style issues; various (pre C99) compilers may\nnot behave the same.\n6.2.2 Avoid banners or other decoration around blocks of comments.\nBanners can be useful to highlight logical divisions within a file; such as\nbefore vital sections. This type of usage should be minimized.\n6.2.3 Avoid comments where the opening comment characters are alone on a line.\n/*\n * VIOLATION: Horror Vacui\n*/\nor\n//\n// VIOLATION: Horror Vacui\n//\n\n6.2.4 Do not include jokes or obtuse references in comments.\n\"Out of cheese error!

The code itself should be clear and self-documenting.\nThere is a famously bad comment:\ni = i + 1; // Add one to i\nThis comment provides no information beyond what is already obvious from\nreading the code. There are even worse ways to do it, such as:\n/**********************************\n* *\n* Add one to i *\n* *\n**********************************/\n\n      i=i+1;\n6.3.2 Do not leave markers in the code.\nDon’t leave flags, such as your name, in the code. They may have meaning to you\nbut they do not to other people or projects. Don’t make fancy patterns in your\ncomments so you can search for them later. Always consider that the code and\ncomments represent both you and your company and will very likely be publicly\navailable. The presence of flags, like BugBug, or ToDo statements indicating\nthat comments should be added, reflect poorly upon the programmer.\n6.3.3 Sections of code shall not be “commented out”.\nWhere sections of source code must not be compiled, use conditional compilation\n(such as #if or #ifdef constructs with a descriptive comment) to meet this\nrequirement. C does not support nested comments, and the application of start\nand end comment markers to meet the requirement of source code that must not be\ncompiled is a dangerous practice. This is because comments already existing in\nthe section of code would change the outcome.\n6.3.4 Do not comment out, or otherwise disable, previous revisions of the code.\nRely on your source control system to retain history, not your code.\n6.3.5 Do not use the character sequence “/*” within a comment.\nC does not support the nesting of comments, despite the existence of such\nsupport (as a language extension) within some compilers.

Thus, Doxygen can generate documentation using\njust the existing syntactic elements of the source files, or one can supplement\nthe syntactic documentation using Section 6.8 \"Special Documentation Blocks\".\nThese special documentation blocks are just C or C++ comments with one or more\nspecial tags added.\nFor structures, unions, functions, and global data, you have two documentation\noptions:\n\nPlace a special documentation block in front of the declaration or\ndefinition. For enum, structure, and union members, you are also allowed to\nplace documentation directly after a member. See Section 6.8\n\"Special Documentation Blocks\", to learn more about special documentation\nblocks.\n\nPlace a special documentation block somewhere else (another file or location)\nand put a structural command in the documentation block. A structural\ncommand links a documentation block to a certain entity that can be\ndocumented (e.g. a union, structure, function, or file).\n\n\nThe text inside a special documentation block is parsed before it is written to\nthe output files. During parsing, the following steps take place:\n\nThe special commands inside the documentation block are executed.\n\nIf a line starts with some whitespace followed by one or more asterisks (*)\nand then optionally more whitespace, then all leading whitespace and\nasterisks are removed.\n\nAll resulting blank lines are treated as paragraph separators. This saves\nyou from placing new-paragraph commands yourself in order to make the\ngenerated documentation readable.\n\nLinks to members are automatically created when certain patterns are found\nin the text. These patterns include: URLs and email addresses, names of\ndocumented classes and files, function and variable names, typedef, enum\ntypes, enum values, and defines.\n\nHTML tags that are in the documentation are interpreted and converted to the\nproper equivalents for the selected output type.\n\n\n"},"6_documenting_software/68_special_documentation_blocks.html":{"url":"6_documenting_software/68_special_documentation_blocks.html","title":"6.8 Special Documentation Blocks","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

There is a mechanism to allow\ndocumentation to be placed after the element to be documented (Postfix). Prefix\nstyle comment blocks are described here, while postfix comment blocks are\ndescribed in \"Putting Documentation after Members\" on page 66.\nEach code item can have two types of descriptions. Together, a brief\ndescription and a detailed description form the documentation: Both are\nsemantically optional. More than one brief or detailed description per code\nitem, however, is not allowed. We require at least one of these descriptions to\nbe present.\nA brief description is short, usually a single line. A detailed description\nprovides longer and more detailed documentation.\nYou may place these descriptions in a comment block in several ways:\n\nComment blocks will automatically start a brief description which ends at the\nfirst period followed by a space or new line. For example:\n/** Brief description which ends at this dot.\nThis sentence begins the detailed description. The detailed description\ncontinues...\n**/\n\n\nThe behavior also exists for multi-line special C++ comments:\n/// Brief description which ends at this dot.\n/// This sentence begins the detailed description.\n\n\n\nIt is preferred that any special documentation block longer than two lines use\nC-style commenting as shown in the first example above. While not required by\nDoxygen, we require the blank line between the brief description and the\ndetailed description.\nWithin the body of a C-style comment block, Doxygen will ignore any leading\nspaces and asterisks, '*'. This means that the first example could be rewritten\nas follows without any change in the generated documentation.\n/** Brief description which ends at this dot.\n *\n * This sentence begins the detailed description. The detailed\n * description continues...\n**/\n\nThis type of comment decoration is acceptable because the line of '*' along the\nleft make it easier to determine the extent of the comment.\nAs you can see, Doxygen is quite flexible. For more information, see the full\nDoxygen documentation.\n"},"6_documenting_software/69_putting_documentation_after_members.html":{"url":"6_documenting_software/69_putting_documentation_after_members.html","title":"6.9 Putting Documentation after Members","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The  indicates that the member to be documented is located before\nthe comment.\n\nNote: Only be used these blocks to document members and parameters.

A commands may have one or\nmore arguments. The following typographic conventions are used to identify each\narguments range:\n\nIf sharp> braces are used, the argument is a single word.\n\nIf (round) braces are used, the argument extends until the end of the\nline on which the command was found.\n\nIf {curly} braces are used, the argument extends until the next\nparagraph. Paragraphs are delimited by a blank line or by a section indicator.\n\nIf [square] brackets are used, the argument is optional.\n\n\nThe following sections describe the special Doxygen commands.\n6.10.1 @example \nIndicates that a comment block contains documentation for a source code example.\n6.10.2 @file [  ]\nIndicates that a comment block contains documentation for a source or header\nfile with name . If the file name is omitted, Doxygen uses the name of the\nfile that contains the @file command. This is the preferred method.\n6.10.3 @attention { attention text }\nStarts an indented paragraph where you can enter a message about an issue that\nneeds attention.\n6.10.4 @param[in,out]  { parameter description }\nStarts a parameter description for a function parameter named .\n6.10.5 @post { description of a postcondition }\nStarts an indented paragraph where you can describe a postcondition of an\nentity.\n6.10.6 @pre { description of a precondition }\nStarts an indented paragraph where you can describe a precondition of an entity.\n6.10.7 @retval  { description }\nStarts a description of a return value from a function. Include a separate\n@retval for each unique return value.\n6.10.8 @return { description of what is returned }\nStarts a description for a function's return values when those values aren't\neasily described by @retval commands (that is, the return values are something\nother than a small set of unique values with discrete meanings).\n6.10.9 @sa { references }\nStarts a paragraph where you can specify one or more cross-references to\nfunctions, structures, variables, files, or URLs.\n6.10.10 @since { text }\nThis tag can be used to specify when (version or time) an entity is available.\n6.10.11 @test { paragraph describing a test case }\nStarts a paragraph where you can describe a test case. The description will\nalso add the test case to a separate test list. The two instances of the\ndescription will be cross-referenced. Each test case in the test list will be\npreceded by a header that indicates the origin of the test case.\n6.10.12 @todo { paragraph describing what is to be done }\nStarts a paragraph where a TODO item is described. The description will also\nadd an item to a separate TODO list. The two instances of the description will\nbe cross-referenced. Each item in the TODO list will be preceded by a header\nthat indicates the origin of the item.\n6.10.13 HTML Commands\nFor greater control over the format of generated documentation, you may add\nHTML commands to special documentation blocks. \"HTML Character Entities\" below\nlists the special HTML character entities that Doxygen recognizes.\n\"HTML Commands\" lists the HTML commands that you may use inside the\ndocumentation.\nFinally, to put invisible comments inside comment blocks, you may use HTML\nstyle comments:\n/**  Visible text */\nTable 11 HTML Character Entities\n\n\n\nEntity\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n&copy;\nCopyright symbol\n\n\n&tm;\nTrade mark symbol\n\n\n&reg;\nRegistered trade mark symbol\n\n\n&lt\nLess-than symbol\n\n\n&gt\nGreater-than symbol\n\n\n&amp;\nAmpersand\n\n\n&apos;\nSingle quotation mark (straight)\n\n\n&quot;\nDouble quotation mark (straight)\n\n\n&lsquo;\nLeft single quotation mark\n\n\n&rsquo;\nRight single quotation mark\n\n\n&ldquo;\nLeft double quotation mark\n\n\n&rdquo;\nRight double quotation mark\n\n\n&ndash;\nEn-dash (for numeric ranges, e.g. 2-8)\n\n\n&mdash;\nEm-dash (for parenthetical punctuation-like this)\n\n\n&?uml;\nWhere ? is one of {A,E,I,O,U,Y,a,e,i,o,u,y}, writes a character with a diaeresis accent (ä).\n\n\n&?acute;\nWhere ? is one of {A,E,I,O,U,Y,a,e,i,o,u,y}, writes a character with an acute accent (á).\n\n\n&?grave;\nWhere ? is one of {A,E,I,O,U,a,e,i,o,u,y}, writes a character with a grave accent (à).\n\n\n&?circ;\nWhere ? is one of {A,E,I,O,U,a,e,i,o,u,y}, writes a character with a circumflex accent (â).\n\n\n&?tilde;\nWhere ? is one of {A,N,O,a,n,o}, writes a character with a tilde accent (ã).\n\n\n&szlig;\nSharp s (ß).\n\n\n&?cedil;\nWhere ? is one of {c,C}, writes a c-cedille (ç).\n\n\n&?ring;\nWhere ? is one of {a,A}, writes an 'a' with a ring (å).\n\n\n&nbsp;\nA non breaking space.\n\n\n\nTable 12 HTML Commands\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nStarts an HTML hyper-link.\n\n\n\nStarts a named anchor.\n\n\n\nEnds a link or anchor.\n\n\n\nStarts a piece of text displayed in a bold font.\n\n\n\nEnds a  section.\n\n\n\nDoes not generate any output.\n\n\n\nDoes not generate any output.\n\n\n\nForces a line break.\n\n\n\nStarts a section of centered text.\n\n\n\nEnds a section of centered text.\n\n\n\nStarts a caption.

However, this optimization comes at a penalty.\nRob Pike provides these comments on program complexity,\nhttps://www.lysator.liu.se/c/pikestyle.html, Notes on Programming in C.\n\"Most programs are too complicated - that is, more complex than they need to be\nto solve their problems efficiently . . . But programs are often complicated at\nthe microscopic level . . .\"\nThe following are also condensed from Mr. Pike's 1989 Notes on Programming in\nC\nRule 1. Don't guess at optimization\n\nProve the bottleneck location, then put in a speed hack.\n\nRule 2. Measure before tuning for speed\n\nBe judicious. Only tune for speed if absolutely necessary.\n\nRule 3. Use simple algorithms\n\nFancy algorithms are slow.\n\nRule 4. Use simple data structures.\nPike believes that these data structures are almost always enough:\n\narray\nlinked list\nhash table\nbinary tree\n\nRule 5. Data structures are central to programming; algorithms are not.\n"}}}
